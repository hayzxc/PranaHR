  Show ponytail's measured impact as a compact scoreboard: less code, less
  cost, more speed, from the benchmark medians. One-shot display, not a
  persistent mode, and not a per-repo number. Trigger: /ponytail-gain,

# Ponytail Gain

Display this scoreboard when invoked. One-shot: do NOT change mode, write flag
files, or persist anything.

The figures are the published benchmark medians (5 everyday tasks: email
validator, debounce, CSV sum, countdown timer, rate limiter; three models:
Haiku, Sonnet, Opus). They are measured, not computed from the current repo.
Source: `benchmarks/` and the README.
